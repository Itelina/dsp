[Think Stats Chapter 6 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2007.html#toc60) (household income)

When setting 6.0 as the upper bound (when we assume that highest income is 10^6 or 1 million dollars), these are the values for the log sample:

Mean: 4.6575
Median: 4.7094
Skewness: -0.6413
Pearson's Skewness: -0.3379

45.0% of the households report a taxable income below the mean. 

When we adjust the upper bound to 8 instead, these are the values:

Mean: 4.6813
Median: 4.7094
Skewness: 1.0541
Pearson's Skewness: -0.1546

47.2% of the households report a taxable income below the mean. 

We can see that when we adjusted the upper bound, the median remained roughly the same. Pearson's Skewness measure also continued to report a negative skew. Meanwhile the average value went up, and the Skewness measure became positive.
