[Think Stats Chapter 6 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2007.html#toc60) (household income)

> When setting 6.0 as the upper bound (when we assume that highest income is 10^6 or 1 million dollars), these are the values for sample:

> Mean: 74,278
> Median: 51,226
> Skewness: 4.9499
> Pearson's Skewness: 0.7361

> 66.0% of the households report a taxable income below the mean. 

> When we adjust the upper bound to 8.0 instead, these are the values:

> Mean: 457,453
> Median: 51,226
> Skewness: 14.8924
> Pearson's Skewness: 0.2747

> 97.8% of the households report a taxable income below the mean. 

> We can see that when we adjusted the upper bound, the Pearson's Skewness went down instead. This is because adjusting the upper bound probably has a strong effect on the standard deviation.
